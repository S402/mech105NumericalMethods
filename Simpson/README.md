# Simpson's 1/3 Rule Algorithm
## This algorithm is a **MATLAB** function that takes two matricies as points and uses Simpson's 1/3 Rule to approximate the integral of the points.
### Inputs:
**[x]** x is an array of equally spaced x-values
**[y]** y is an array of y-values corresponding to the array of x-values.
### Outputs:
The function returns 3 matricies
* **I** I returns the approximate integral of the points supplied by the x and y arrays.
